\title{Simulate outcome from regression model}
\usage{
simulate_outcome(X, block_info, type = "binary", sd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix of predictors (output from
\code{simulate_predictors()}).}

\item{block_info}{Data frame describing block structure. Must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{block_id}: Unique identifier for each block.
\item \code{block_size}: Number of variables per block.
\item \code{effect_size}: Numeric effect size for the block (0 for
noise blocks).
}}

\item{type}{Character describing type of outcome ("binary" or "continuous")}

\item{sd}{Numeric stating standard deviation to use for normally distributed
error (default: 1)}
}
\value{
A vector of simulated outcomes (0/1 for binary).
}
\description{
Generates a binary or continuous outcome based on a logistic or linear
regression model, respectively. Each block (defined in \code{block_info}) can
have its own effect size. For each block the first principal component is
estimated and used as independent variable in the regression model.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
block_info <- data.frame(
  block_id = c("A", "B"),
  block_size = c(5, 5),
  effect_size = c(1, 0.5)
)

# binary outcome
y <- simulate_outcome(X, block_info, type = "binary")
table(y)

# continuous outcome
y <- simulate_outcome(X, block_info, type = "continuous")
summary(y)
}
