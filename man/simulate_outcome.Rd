\title{Simulate binary outcome from logistic regression}
\usage{
simulate_outcome(X, block_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix of predictors (output from
\code{simulate_predictors()}).}

\item{block_info}{Data frame describing block structure. Must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{block_id}: Unique identifier for each block.
\item \code{block_size}: Number of variables per block.
\item \code{effect_size}: Numeric effect size for the block (0 for
noise blocks).
}}
}
\value{
A binary vector of simulated outcomes (0/1).
}
\description{
Generates a binary outcome based on a logistic regression model,
where each block (defined in \code{block_info}) can have its own effect size.
For each block the first principal component is estimated and used as
independent variable in the regression model.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
block_info <- data.frame(
  block_id = c("A", "B"),
  block_size = c(5, 5),
  effect_size = c(1, 0.5)
)
y <- simulate_outcome(X, block_info)
table(y)
}
